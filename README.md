# Emoji Check !
## Description
Emoji Check ! is an Android app which lets see the correspondence of emoji between devices. I created this app because lots of my messages were misinterpreted because of wrong emoji correspondence (typical example: a crying smiley interpreted as a laugh out one).

## Why Open Source?
I made this project Open Source because I really have a lack of time and I find it a pity that the project "sleep" on my PC whereas users ask me some improvement. Moreover I think my work can be useful for other people dealing with the same issues as me. I tried to make the code the less "Android dependent" as possible.

## Contributing
As I said in the previous section, one of the main reason why I made this project open source is to improve the app depending on user reviews. So feel free to contribute.
